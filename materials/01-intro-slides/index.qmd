**California Survey**. In the early 1900's Joseph Grinnell, the first director of the University of California, Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, organized a monumental effort to document California's plants and animals in their natural state. Teams of scientists embarked on transects across the state from west to east, meticulously documenting the location, density and appearance of the flora and fauna they encountered and collected. The resulting archive of animal specimens and journal notes has provided today's scientists with the unparalleled opportunity to follow those same transects and see what has changed during the last century.

General map (based on the Coulterville 15 min quadrangle available at that time) of area between Coulterville and Dudleys in Mariposa County, with position of traplines marked, elevational contours, life zones and so on given.

Ecologist Jonathan Kingdon writes that drawing “represents a species of translation that is different from what emerges in photography. Given the new research on how the brain processes visual input and given that drawing is a mental process, no further justification need be made for the utility of drawing in lifting out relevance from within the chaos of actual visual experience.”

## Dynamic documentation

### Any time that the underlying data, analysis, or code change...  

::: {.incremental}

- figures and tables are *automatically* generated

- results in text are *automatically* rendered 

- final content is *automatically* updated

## Advantages ([source](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html))

### (1) Eliminate human error in copying and pasting results

> We found that half of all published psychology papers that use null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion

[@nuijten2015]


## Advantages ([source](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html))

### (2) Easy revisions and specification of desired figures and tables

> When revisions are requested, one may have to constantly modify tables and figures by hand, which creates a strong incentive not to rerun analyses because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustrating all the numbers and figures in an article.


## Advantages ([source](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html))

### (3) Promote computational reproducibility

> Easy verification and replication of research findings

> While programming environments may seem counter-intuitive for writing papers, they ultimately prevent mistakes and save time.

## Advantages: Save time?

## Current state of affairs ([source](https://mine.quarto.pub/quarto-manuscripts-rmed/#/title-slide))

Most computational science is **born in notebooks**

::: incremental
-   Peer-review and publication workflows **don't support notebooks** as research outputs
-   The more complex scenarios involve a lot of **manual handling** to bring the project to journal submission
-   Often during this process **reproducibility is lost**, or takes second seat to the formatting requirements
-   Final submission **rarely captures all computations**, which are, at best, relegated to supplementary materials
:::

and ~~dies~~ **ends in PDF or Word documents**

## How many tools do you use to produce these types of results? {.center .r-fit-text}


# Hello Quarto {background-color="#4f6952"}

::: {.fragment}
One source, many output formats

## What is in a notebook?


::: {.incremental}
A notebook is a (cloud-based/local) **dynamic document** composed of cells, which is used for **literate programming**

Each cell may contain:

- narrative/text/documentation, or
- executable code, or 
- results as code output (charts, tables, plots, maps, ...)

::: 

## What is in a `Quarto` notebook?


::: {.incremental}
A `Quarto` notebook is a (cloud-based/local) **dynamic document** (`.qmd`) composed of cells, which is used for **literate programming**

Each cell may contain:

- narrative/text/documentation in **Markdown** format, or
- executable code (R, Python, Julia and Observable), or 
- results as code output (charts, tables, plots, maps, ...)

::: 


## Quarto (`.qmd`)

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and can:

::: {.incremental}

-   **be authored** in your favourite code editor
-   **render** from `qmd` or Jupyter notebook to PDF, Word, HTML, slides, web pages, blog posts, books, etc.
-   **execute** code in R, Python, Julia and Observable
-   **apply** journal styles to your outputs with Quarto extensions
-   **publish** to GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.
-   **orchestrate** multiple inputs and outputs with Quarto projects
