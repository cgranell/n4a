    "text": "To ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the course to conform to the Code of Conduct given below. This code applies to all spaces related to the course including, but not limited to, classroom, ‘aula virtual’, emails, shared documents, and code repositories. We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.\n\nYou can report Code of Conduct violations in person to Carlos Granell.\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.\nHarassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent.\nProhibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;\nthe display of sexual or violent images;\nunwelcome sexual attention;\nnon-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications;\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and\npublication of private communication without consent.\n\nBehaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.\nEnforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nThis code of conduct is a simplification of the CoC for Reproducible Research workshos at AGILE, which is based on a CoC for Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson, which in turn is based on that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki."

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.t stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

In the early 1900’s Joseph Grinnell, the first director of the University of California, Berkeley’s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, organized a monumental effort to document California’s plants and animals in their natural state. Teams of scientists embarked on transects across the state from west to east, meticulously documenting the location, density and appearance of the flora and fauna they encountered and collected. The resulting archive of animal specimens and journal notes has provided today’s scientists with the unparalleled opportunity to follow those same transects and see what has changed during the last century.\nA page from the field notes of Charles L.
